## How the idea formed: PhotoPaste and Audio Note Taking

The idea for Notello didn't emerge fully formed. It started with a project called [PhotoPaste](https://www.aidangollan.com/projects/14). PhotoPaste was a straightforward tool: it allowed users to scan an image of text on their phone and have it instantly become pasteable through a Chrome extension. This solved a simple but common problem for students and researchers alike, and was a fun learning experience.

### Audio Note Taking

Building on the concept of PhotoPaste, the next idea I had was a tool that would allow students to record audio of their lectures and automatically generate study materials based on that recording. This concept began to approach the core of what would eventually become Notello: automating the process of turning raw course content into useful study aids.

## The Evolution of Notello

### Phase 1: Individual Study Website

The first incarnation of Notello was conceptualized as a website where users could upload their own study materials and have them automatically converted into flashcards or quiz questions. This individual approach seemed promising until I discoverd a competitor, [turbolearn.ai](https://www.turbolearn.ai/), who was already offering a similar service.

### Phase 2: Shared Knowledge Aggregation

This setback led to the first major pivot for Notello. Instead of focusing on individual use, Notello was reimagined as a shared knowledge aggregation platform. In this version, study materials and course content would be shared by everyone in a given course. Each course on Notello would correspond to a real course at a user's university, allowing students in the same class to access a shared pool of information.

### Phase 3: Knowledge Graph Integration

The latest and most significant development in Notello's evolution is the integration of knowledge graph technology. This addition turns the platform's information into an easily queryable store of knowledge. The use of a knowledge graph allows Notello to identify the most important topics in a note or across an entire course, enabling the generation of more comprehensive and relevant summaries for users.

## Current Status and Future Plans

As of now, Notello is still in active development. The team is working on refining the platform's features and ensuring a smooth user experience. The current plan is to launch Notello in the fall of 2024.
