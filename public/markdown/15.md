## Weird Spotify : My Favorite Project Yet

Weird Spotify was a project I thought up one day while watching Tiktok of all things.
The video was showing Twitter screenshots of different funny Spotify playlists, with the titles of the
songs spelling out a sentence of some sort.

This inspired me to make a tool that would do that for you, and I called it Weird Spotify!

### How it works
The tool works by taking in a sentence in any language (not just english), and turns that sentence
into a playlist on Spotify, where each word in the sentence translates to a song in the playlist.

For example
```python
Input = Hello my lovely friends my name is aidan!
```

The ouput might be something like this (the playlist can be found [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/04AJcQyUVOLZUorbOJH7Uz)):
